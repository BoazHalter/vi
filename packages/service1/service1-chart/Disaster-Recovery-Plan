## Disaster Recovery Plan

### 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**
This document outlines the procedures and processes to be followed to recover critical business operations in the event of a disaster.

**Scope:**
The plan covers all critical systems and applications, and includes roles, responsibilities, and step-by-step recovery procedures.

### 2. Objectives

- Ensure the safety of all employees.
- Minimize the disruption of operations.
- Recover critical business functions within an acceptable timeframe.
- Protect organizational data and assets.
- Ensure effective communication during and after a disaster.

### 3. Definitions

**Disaster:** Any event that disrupts normal business operations, including natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods), technological incidents (e.g., cyberattacks, system failures), and human-caused events (e.g., terrorism, sabotage).

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The maximum acceptable length of time that a system can be down after a disaster.

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.

### 4. Roles and Responsibilities

**Disaster Recovery Team:**
- **DR Coordinator:** Oversees the DR process and ensures communication between all parties.
- **IT Lead:** Manages the recovery of IT systems and applications.
- **Communications Lead:** Ensures timely and accurate communication with stakeholders.
- **Facilities Lead:** Manages the physical aspects of the recovery, including access to buildings and safety.
- **Business Unit Leads:** Represent each critical business unit and coordinate recovery efforts within their areas.

### 5. Risk Assessment

**Potential Risks:**
- Natural Disasters: Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes.
- Technological Failures: Hardware failures, software bugs, power outages.
- Cyber Threats: Ransomware, data breaches, DDoS attacks.
- Human Errors: Accidental data deletion, configuration errors.

### 6. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

Identify and prioritize critical business functions and the impact of their disruption. Determine RTO and RPO for each function.

### 7. Preventive Measures

- Regular backups of all critical data.
- Use of redundant systems and failover mechanisms.
- Implementation of robust cybersecurity measures.
- Regular maintenance and updates of all hardware and software.

### 8. Recovery Strategies

**Data Recovery:**
- Use off-site backups stored in geographically distant locations.
- Implement cloud-based backup solutions.

**System Recovery:**
- Maintain hot, warm, or cold standby environments as per business needs.
- Use virtualization technologies for rapid system recovery.

**Application Recovery:**
- Ensure that all critical applications are included in regular backup schedules.
- Document the steps required to restore each application.

### 9. DR Procedures

**Immediate Response:**
1. **Activation:**
   - DR Coordinator assesses the situation and declares a disaster if necessary.
   - Notify all DR team members and stakeholders.

2. **Safety Measures:**
   - Ensure the safety of all employees.
   - Evacuate premises if required.

3. **Initial Assessment:**
   - IT Lead evaluates the extent of damage to systems and infrastructure.

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Data Recovery:**
   - Restore data from the latest backup.
   - Verify data integrity and consistency.

2. **System Recovery:**
   - Rebuild affected systems using standby environments or virtualization technologies.
   - Test systems to ensure they are operational.

3. **Application Recovery:**
   - Restore critical applications.
   - Conduct functional tests to confirm proper operation.

4. **Communication:**
   - Regular updates to stakeholders on recovery progress.
   - Coordinate with external partners and vendors as needed.

### 10. Testing and Maintenance

**Regular Testing:**
- Conduct DR drills and simulations biannually.
- Test backup and recovery procedures regularly.

**Plan Maintenance:**
- Review and update the DR plan annually or after any major change to the business environment.
- Incorporate lessons learned from tests and actual events.

### 11. Appendices

**Appendix A: Contact List**
- List of all DR team members with contact information.
- Key external contacts (e.g., vendors, emergency services).

**Appendix B: Inventory of Critical Systems**
- Detailed inventory of all critical systems, applications, and data.

**Appendix C: Recovery Checklists**
- Step-by-step checklists for recovery of each critical business function.

### Example DR Plan for an IT System

**Recovery of Database Server:**

1. **Activate Disaster Recovery Team.**
2. **Assess damage and confirm need for recovery.**
3. **Notify all stakeholders and declare disaster.**
4. **Ensure data backup is available and intact.**
5. **Provision new server or activate standby server.**
6. **Restore database from backup.**
7. **Verify data integrity.**
8. **Test database connectivity and functionality.**
9. **Communicate recovery progress and completion to stakeholders.**

By following this template and customizing it to your organization's specific needs, you can create a robust disaster recovery plan that helps ensure business continuity and resilience against various types of disasters.
